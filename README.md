This project is a game called checkers, which a player plays with the computer. 
In this project, I used the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) approach. 
Basically, I did not write all the code in one file, but in different files like 
Options.py or Play.py, and then called them in the main file, which only calls other 
functions from other files being imported in the main.py. 
The algorithm used for returning the computer moves is the MinMax Algorithm (https://www.javatpoint.com/mini-max-algorithm-in-ai). 
The Big-O analyzer for this algorithm is: Time complexity - O(b^d) and Space Complexity - O(bd). This algorithm is implemented in MinMax_Algorithm.py.



For the graphical part of the game, I used a Python library called Pygame.                                     
It is required that the Pygame library should be installed before running the game.
